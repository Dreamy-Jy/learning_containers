# Session 1 Plan

## Goals

Get a broad overview of how containers are materialized by the OS.
Write a program that:

- CRUDs containers
- Has a comprehensive test plan

Support

- [Writing a container in Rust](https://litchipi.site/serie/containers_in_rust)
- [Linux containers in 500 lines of code](https://blog.lizzie.io/linux-containers-in-500-loc.html)
- [Build Your Own Container Using Less than 100 Lines of Go](https://www.infoq.com/articles/build-a-container-golang/)
